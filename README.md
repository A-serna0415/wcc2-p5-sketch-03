# Creatures_Generator
*This project is a creative coding sketch made using p5.js.*

## Description
*I wanted to play around with the *Genetic Algorithms* Daniel Shiffman talks about in The Nature of Code. Basically, these algorithms try to mimic Darwinian natural selection in a rough, code-based way: species evolving generation after generation. In my case, I used a genetic algorithm to build a very (and I mean very) simple creature generator.*
*Each creature’s traits (its *DNA*) are stored in an OOP class, which lets the genetic algorithm tweak the population’s characteristics every generation. The sketch starts with a first generation of six creatures. When the user hovers the cursor over one, its fitness value goes up—meaning it has a better chance of surviving into the next generation. When the user clicks the Evolve to Next Generation button, the creatures with the highest fitness become the genetic base for the new population. As the user keeps evolving generations, the creatures end up becoming either more diverse or oddly similar.*

## How to Run
*Open the link below in your browser once GitHub Pages is enabled:*
*https://github.com/A-serna0415/wcc2-p5-sketch-03.git*

**Instructions:**
1. Hover the cursor over the creature to increase its fitness value, which means, its chances to survive the next generation.
2. Press *Evolve Next Generation* button to evolve the creatures.
3. Refresh the sketch to go back to the generation 0.
